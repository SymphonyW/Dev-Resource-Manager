# Dev Resource Manager

[Download Windows installer](https://github.com/SymphonyW/Dev-Resource-Manager/releases/latest/download/dev-resource-manager-amd64-installer.exe)

Dev Resource Manager is a Windows desktop application for developers who need a clear view of local processes, ports, and system resource usage.

It is built with Wails, Go, React, TypeScript, and Vite. The project focuses on practical local diagnostics: finding which process owns a port, reviewing resource usage, and safely stopping development-related processes when needed.

## Features

| Area | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard | View CPU, memory, process, port, and GPU-related system resource data |
| Processes | Inspect running processes, resource usage, executable paths, commands, and process details |
| Ports | Identify occupied TCP/UDP ports and map them back to owning processes |
| Cleanup | Review development-related processes before taking cleanup actions |
| Safety | Protect critical Windows processes from accidental termination |
| Logs | Track process and cleanup operations for later review |
| Settings | Configure application behavior and protected process rules |

## Download

Windows builds are published from GitHub Actions as unsigned installers.

Download the latest release from:

```text
https://github.com/SymphonyW/Dev-Resource-Manager/releases
```

Current Windows installers are not code signed. Windows SmartScreen or "Unknown publisher" warnings may appear during installation. Only install packages downloaded from the official GitHub Releases page or trusted CI artifacts.

## Development

Requirements:

| Tool | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | 10/11 |
| Go | 1.24 or newer |
| Node.js / npm | Node 22.x recommended |
| Wails CLI | v2.12.0 |

Install the Wails CLI:

```powershell
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@v2.12.0
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```powershell
npm --prefix frontend install
```

Run the desktop app with live reload:

```powershell
wails dev
```

## Build

Build the Windows executable:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1
```

Build the unsigned Windows installer:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-windows.ps1
```

Generated files are written to:

```text
build/bin/
```

For the full Windows release process, see [docs/release-windows.md](docs/release-windows.md).

## Verification

Before publishing a release, run:

```powershell
go test ./...
npm --prefix frontend run build
.\scripts\package-windows.ps1
```

Then verify the generated installer on a clean Windows machine:

```text
Install -> launch -> check main pages -> uninstall -> confirm shortcuts and install files are removed
```

## Release

The repository includes a manual GitHub Actions workflow:

```text
Windows Release Build
```

The workflow installs Go, Node.js, Wails, and NSIS, builds the Windows installer, and uploads the unsigned Windows package as an artifact.

Release signing is intentionally not wired to real credentials. Code signing placeholders are documented in [docs/release-windows.md](docs/release-windows.md), and certificates, tokens, passwords, and private keys must remain outside the repository.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Wails |
| Backend | Go |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite |
| Packaging | Wails Windows build, NSIS |
| CI | GitHub Actions |
